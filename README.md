## Onyx Offensive - Demo Scanner
WRAITH-20: STEP-PEN INTELLIGENCE
Meet The Wraith-20. 💻  A professional-grade cyber scanner Powered by the Onyx Offensive protocol.  🔹 Phase: 20-Step Deep Pentest Recon 🔹 Target: Full perimeter visibility 🔹 Result: Zero blind spots.  Total Field Domination. 🛡️

Standard scanners "spray and pray." Wraith-20 is different. Our proprietary Step-Pen (Step-wise Penetration) methodology maps your entire external attack surface and then "steps" through exploitation paths in real-time. It validates which vulnerabilities are theoretical and which are catastrophic. It’s not a 200-page report of fluff—it’s a tactical strike list.
