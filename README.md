# WRAITH-20 // ONYX OFFENSIVE
### *The Rose Gold Standard in Step-Pen Intelligence.*

## 💎 The Wraith-20 Philosophy
Standard security assessments are cluttered and unfocused. **Wraith-20** is the elite alternative. 

Powered by the **Onyx Offensive Protocol**, our proprietary **Step-Pen (Step-wise Penetration)** methodology doesn't just list vulnerabilities—it maps tactical attack paths. We provide full perimeter visibility and real-time exploitation validation to ensure **Total Field Domination.**

### **The 20-Phase Tactical Sequence**
Wraith-20 executes a surgical, high-fidelity reconnaissance path designed for high-stakes infrastructure:
* **Intelligence Mapping:** Subdomain Discovery to DNS Infrastructure.
* **Surface Analysis:** Web App Mapping and Source Code Recon.
* **Exploitation Validation:** Credential Breach and Auth Assessment.
* **Executive Action:** Data Exfiltration and Tactical Reporting.
